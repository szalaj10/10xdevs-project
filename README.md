## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.14.0)
- npm (>=8.x) or yarn
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (optional, to pin Node version)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/10xdevs-project.git
cd 10xdevs-project
nvm use           # if you use nvm
npm install       # or yarn install
```

### Environment Setup

1. **Set up Supabase locally**

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g supabase

# Start local Supabase instance
supabase start

# Get your service role key
supabase status
```

2. **Create environment file**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Get these from 'supabase status' command
SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# For client-side (browser) access
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Optional: OpenRouter API key for AI generation
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key-here
```

3. **Run database migrations**

```bash
supabase db reset
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:4321` to view the app.

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Web-only (desktop & mobile responsive)
- AI-assisted card generation from free-text topic (10â€“20 candidates)
- Candidate management (accept/edit/reject, bulk accept)
- Simple SRS session (3 ratings: hard, normal, easy; fixed intervals)
- Basic Markdown support with character limits (front â‰¤200, back â‰¤350)
- Deck & card CRUD (inline edit, duplicate warnings)
- Search & listing of decks/cards
- Analytics events for key user actions

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Advanced import/export (APKG, Anki/Notion/Quizlet)
- Offline mode or push notifications
- Complex SRS algorithms (FSRS, SM-2 tuning)
- Collaboration, sharing, tagging
- Native mobile apps
